generify objects more
    maybe need to be using smart pointers?

have objects update based on environment
    Methods to try
        objects with update
            each object has update that is passed game state and uses that to change velocity, fire, etc
            each object also has update where given keys and will update state based on that
        engine with controllers
            have a vector of controllers that use the state and their subject object to change the object

game state can play multiple games
